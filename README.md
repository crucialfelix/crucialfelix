# Chris Sattinger

Strong engineering, architecture, product and project management background experience with a focus on climate tech and sustainability.

20 years experience as a software engineer in backend and frontend web development, systems design and architeture, devops, infra, data and ML engineering.

At the moment I'm focused on learning ML engineering and AI product development—the entire process from product conception, acquiring and augmenting datasets, ML systems design, deploying to production systems.

I'm currently building sensilla.io — an API SaaS for scraping data and building reactive data pipelines. With this I collect public data relevant to climate and industry.
